        <h1>A Balcony and a Sunset</h1>
        <p>I woke after a long sleep,<br>
        with a hot cup of coffee in my hand—<br>
        standing in the balcony,<br>
        staring at the evening orange sunset.</p>

        <p>My mind begins to fill with—<br>
        some strange thoughts.</p>

        <p>Love, and the kind of relationships—<br>
        They aren't easy at all,<br>
        You have to work on them,<br>
        spend time and efforts.</p>

        <p>Talking about relationships...<br>
        letting go holds dimensions of pain.<br>
        There is a death,<br>
        and also,<br>
        a morning sunrise in letting go.</p>

        <p>Happiness—<br>
        You can find in different ways,<br>
        from different people,</p>

        <p>Sometimes, it hides in:<br>
        giving gifts, receiving gifts,<br>
        showing and offering love,<br>
        receiving love, helping people,<br>
        caring, hugging, playful teasing,<br>
        spending for the ones you love.</p>

        <p>And also—<br>
        Sometimes,<br>
        happiness flows out from the eyes:<br>
        inaudible, voiceless, silent tears—<br>
        unveiled feelings.</p>

        <p>Horrible?<br>
        Life is strange,<br>
        Sometimes, too strange.<br>
        Holding on to the past<br>
        feels like yapping about an unseen ghost.</p>


        <p>Life is strange,<br>
        because strangers are strange.<br>
        Strangers become friends,<br>
        The most trusted ones, partners...<br>
        And sometimes lovers.</p>

        <p>Seeking the red string—<br>
        Yet never found it,<br>
        So I decided to chase the sun and stars,<br>
        In the mid skies of day and night.</p>

        <p>Listening to those thoughts,<br>
        my cup becomes empty.<br>
        As so—<br>
        ready to refill.</p>
