        <h1>Kerosene and Love</h1>
        <p>A strange glance cast over me—<br>
        From afar,<br>
        She wanted me to saw her back.<br>
        For a moment, instead<br>
        I fell into<br>
        A glimpse of you and I.<br>
        Intended to care, love, linger, but—<br>
        All she want was—a look, a moment's attention.<br>
        Care,<br>
        Taken for granted.<br>
        Love,<br>
        Seen as baggage of burden, unwanted for the moment.<br>
        All I showed was pure, No libido,<br>
        But she craved more and more,<br>
        Like how it ended—<br>
        I was burning down in the fire<br>
        Kerosene all over me,<br>
        She stood in front of me,<br>
        She asked,<br>
        “Why won't you see me?”<br>
        My skin burned,<br>
        Aching to my heart,<br>
        Bones turning black.<br>
        Me, and my love for you,<br>
        Burned all away.<br>
        Still, you only craved attention,<br>
        Peak attention.<br>
        You lunatic.<br>
        What kind of animal are you?</p>
