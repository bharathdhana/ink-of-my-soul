        <h1>A Dream</h1>
        <p>As I woke up, I heard a voice of a girl,<br>
        Playing with her toy,<br>
        In the backyard of the home,</p>
        
        <p>As I looked her face,<br>
        Found it was familiar to me,<br> 
        She called me dad,<br>
        And she said “Come and play with me papa”.</p>
        
        <p>I heard a another voice,<br>
        Right behind me that whisper's,<br>
        “Honey, are you awake”<br>
         I found out,<br>
        It was you in and yet surprised,<br>
        We are married,<br>
        As we talked about having a baby girl,<br>
        And it was happening,<br>
        Right in front of me.</p>
        
        <p>I still can't believe,<br>
        You are mine and,<br>
        I'm yours,<br>
        I wish it could me real;</p>
        
        <p>Heard an alarm sound,<br>
        And found out, it wasn't real,<br>
        It was just a dream,<br>
        A beautiful dream </p>
        
    </div>
