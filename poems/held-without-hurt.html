    <h1>Held Without Hurt</h1>
    <p>At the spark of something,<br>
    You’ve been showing me.<br>
    A feeling I’ve never known in my entire life.<br>
    No wonder—<br>
    Why are you doing this to me?<br>
    Why me, when you could find someone better?<br>
    I’ve been pushing you away,<br>
    Yet you keep showing up.<br>
    Again and again.<br>
    Why?<br>
    What do you see in me?<br>
    What in me caught your eyes?<br>
    I like the way you say my name.<br>
    There’s so much I want to share—<br>
    But maybe it’s better kept quiet.<br>
    Still, I’m grateful.<br>
    You’re the one holding me,<br>
    Without ever hurting me.</p>

    <p>You’ve become the thought I can’t ignore—<br>
    A comfort I never knew I was craving.<br>
    I’ve built walls no one was meant to climb,<br>
    But you’re not breaking them…<br>
    You’re just standing there, patient.<br>
    And maybe that means something.<br>
    It scares me—<br>
    Because this doesn’t feel like a game.<br>
    It feels like someone might actually stay.<br>
    And maybe, for the first time,<br>
    I don’t want to run.</p>

    <p>If your heart speak honesty,<br>
    And your touch holds no harm…<br>
    Then maybe—<br>
    I’ll let you:<br>
    Touch me, <br>
    Hold me, <br>
    Kiss me—<br>
    Like you see all of me.</p>
