        <h1>Mr. Moon's Post Office</h1>
            <p>A little girl sat by candlelight,<br>
            Writing a letter late one night—<br>
            To someone she missed,<br>
            To someone above,<br>
            A letter filled with sorrow and love.<br>
            She raised her head and looked outside,<br>
            Through pale clouds and skies so wide.<br>
            A full moon glowed, calm and bright,<br>
            Bathing her tears in silver light.<br>
            Her mother said with a quiet tone,</p>

            <p>“If you miss your grandma, you’re not alone.<br>
            Write her a letter, from your room—<br>
            And send it to Mr. Moon.<br>
            He’ll know what to do.”</p>
            
            <p>So the child wrote with trembling pen,<br>
            About picnics, lullabies, and “back then.”<br>
            Then whispered through the window pane,<br>
            Her little prayer, soft like rain—<br><br>
            “Mr. Moon, please send this letter<br>
            To my beloved Grandma in the stars.<br>
            Tell her I miss her more than ever,<br>
            And ask her—<br>
            Can she visit in the summer holidays?”</p>
            
            <p>Far away, in the silent deep,<br>
            The Moon stirred softly from his sleep.<br>
            He heard the voice, pure and small,<br>
            And turned to face the Earth’s sweet call.<br>
            With a faint smile, he sighed inside,<br><br>
            “My cratered chest is filled with tides—<br>
            Of letters forgotten, wishes unsaid,<br>
            Words from the living, tears from the dead.”<br>
            ---<br>
            “They ask me for magic,<br>
            For love returned,<br>
            For moments lost,<br>
            For bridges burned.<br>
            And though I’m just a ball of stone,<br>
            Somehow I make them feel less alone.”</p>

            <p>so he cradled her words with care,<br>
            Tucked the note in the night’s cool air.<br>
            Not promising miracles, nor replies—<br>
            But watching her dreams drift into the skies.</p>
