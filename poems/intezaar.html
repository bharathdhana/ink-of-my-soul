    <h1>Intezaar</h1>
    <p>"Intezaar" –<br>
        The most beautiful word<br>
        I've ever heard.</p>
        <p>
        Waiting for something,<br>
        A delicate, heart full thing.</p>
        <p>
        A farmer waits for the sky<br>
        To pour down rain, <br>
        For a small seed<br>
        To grow into a beautiful tree, <br>
        For a bud to blossom<br>
        Into a glorious, colourful flower.</p>
        <p>
        A father waits for his child<br>
        To enter this world,<br>
        Like decades passing,<br>
        As if waiting for a shrub<br>
        To bloom upon distant hills,<br>
        Or for another leap year to arrive.</p>
        <p>
        As if waiting for a solar eclipse,<br>
        Or a child watching the clock,<br>
        Hoping for their parent’s return<br>
        From a long day at school.<br>
        Hoping for someone, somewhere,<br>
        To return home safe,<br>
        With miracles yet to unfold<br>
        In their own life.</p>
        <p>
        Even gods wait for their goddesses –<br>
        As Radha waits for Krishna,<br>
        As Sita waits for Rama,<br>
        As Urmila waits for Laxman.</p>
        <p>
        Waiting for loved ones,<br>
        Waiting for a heart to turn,<br>
        To accept the love offered.</p>
        <p>
        "Intezaar" –<br>
        Not everyone can wait for you,<br>
        But if you find one who does,<br>
        Don’t let them go.<br></p>
