        <h1>Unromantic Romance</h1>

        <p>After a long day,<br>
            I returned home,<br>
            Walked straight to my room<br>
            Lying lifeless on my bed,<br>
            Staring at the ceiling.</p>

        <p>My mind echoes,<br>
            The unfading touch of nightmares,<br>
            Bittersweet moments<br>
            From the months spent with you.</p>

        <p>No expectations,<br>
            Yet still—can’t believe.<br>
            Assumptions failed.<br>
            You chose someone else,<br>
            After making me believe<br>
            I was the one—<br>
            Gifted, chosen, admired.<br>
            In the end, I wasn’t.</p>

        <p>What made me chase you, choose you?<br>
            When I was doing fine on my own?<br>
            Why did you appear in my view?<br>
            Why those windows, those stares?<br>
            Why those smiles, those waving hands?</p>

        <p>You came like a star,<br>
            And disappeared<br>
            Like ashes in the wind.</p>

        <p>You left me in a void;<br>
            A hollow space of hopeless hope.<br>
            An unromantic romance,<br>
            Distance,<br>
            Devouring me silently.</p>

        <p>My emotions—my own.<br>
            Never your responsibility.<br>
            How? Yet somehow?<br>
            Your inconvenience, your guilt,<br>
            Became my burden.</p>

        <p>I don’t want you back.<br>
            Stay where you are—<br>
            Left in an ocean of sharks,<br>
            Don’t bother wondering<br>
            How I make it to shore?</p>

        <p>I chose peace.<br>
            I chose solitude.<br>
            I chose me—<br>
            Over you.</p>
