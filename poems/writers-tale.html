        <h1>Writer's Tale</h1>
        
        <p>O Beloved,<br>
        O Beloved,<br>
        A writer's love<br>
        Is different.</p>

        <p>If a writer loves you,<br>
        You will never die —<br>
        Their words will melt<br>
        You down to the core.</p>

        <p>If the writer wrote Come,<br>
        She came.<br>
        If the writer wrote Sit,<br>
        She sat.</p>

        <p>If he wrote Lay your head on my shoulder,<br>
        She rested there.<br>
        He wrote Sleep,<br>
        And she drifted away.</p>
        
        <p>If he wrote Lost,<br>
        She wandered,<br>
        And when he wrote Restless,<br>
        She became uneasy.<br>
        Seeing her pain, he stumbled — heartache.<br>
        So he removed less from the word,<br>
        So she could rest.</p>

        <p>When the writer wrote Special,<br>
        She felt butterflies stir within her.<br>
        When he wrote Aim,<br>
        She chased after him.<br>
        When he wrote Love,<br>
        She fell for him.<br>
        And when he wrote Stay,<br>
        She stayed — forever.</p>
