        <h1>A Boy and a Coin</h1>
        <p>A poor mother gave her son a penny,<br>
        “Just enough”, she smiled, “for a treat, if any.”<br>
        He held it close, a treasure so bright,<br>
        A little golden star, his heart's delight.</p>

        <p>Off to the shop, he skipped with glee,<br>
        But the coin slipped, rolled to a tree.<br>
        Into the grass, lost from the sight,<br>
        But nature stirred with magic that night.</p>

        <p>A squirrel peeked out, quick and spry,<br>
        It nudged the coin with a curious eye.<br>
        Daisies leaned in, their petals glow,<br>
        Guiding the coin where the soft winds blow.</p>

        <p>A fish in the brook flicked it high,<br>
        And a robin swooped down from the sky.<br>
        The boy caught the coin with joy anew,<br>
        A small bit of magic, a blessing so true.</p>
