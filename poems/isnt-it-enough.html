        <h1>Isn't it Enough?</h1>
        <p>I have crossing miles for you—<br>
            Didn’t you see the way I long for you?<br>
            A touch of longevity from you,</p>

        <p>This heart, once yours,<br>
            Can hold the pain,<br>
            But can never love again—<br>
            That is the only gift I have left to offer.</p>

        <p>Didn’t you see my wounds?<br>
            Bleeding for you,<br>
            Marked by the scars you give.</p>

        <p>Don’t take it for granted—<br>
            This Love, this soul I surrendered,<br>
            Was meant to bring peace and harmony.</p>

        <p>Why can’t you see?<br>
            The love, the care I held for you.<br>
            An admirer, always watching—<br>
            Like gazing at the moon in a lonely night sky.</p>

        <P>Wondering, what went wrong?<br>
            Me? You? Us?<br>
            Was I not enough?<br>
            Was love not enough?<br>
            Was it ever enough?<br>
            Isn’t it enough?</P>
