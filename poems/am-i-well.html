        <h1>Am I Well?</h1>

        <p>I don’t feel well.<br>
        My mind is screaming<br>
        Voices in my head—haunting me,<br>
        A full recap of all I did,<br>
        And all I didn’t.</p>

        <p>Career, friends, and the connections I’ve made—<br>
        Now questioning me,<br>
        Betrayed.<br>
        Cornered and crooked in the dimming light.<br>
        Love and relationships—the worst part.<br>
        Taken for granted, trash cans.<br>
        The efforts I made?<br>
        Just a topic in her friends’ gossips.</p>

        <p>Wondering…<br>
        Why was I made this way?<br>
        Questioning my very existence—why all of this?<br>
        The room is filled with haunting shadows of the past,<br>
        My soul screams beneath an ocean of darkness.<br>
        Blinded. Rustled. Bruised.<br>
        Running for so long through this dark room,<br>
        And no shining door to escape through.</p>

        <p>A sad, sad symphony plays,<br>
        Unraveling a city of lost hopes<br>
        And unanswered prayers.<br>
        I can’t see anything in there.<br>
        Just hopeless, slow music in my mind,<br>
        Interrupted by<br>
        Voiceless cries…<br>
        I can’t feel anything—<br>
        Not even me.</p>
